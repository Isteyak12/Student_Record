Certainly! Here's a README.md file that outlines the Docker setup and provides instructions for building and running the Docker container with the C++ linked list code.

# Dockerized C++ Linked List Application

This repository contains a C++ application demonstrating linked list operations inside a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker build -t my_cpp_app .
```

This command uses the Dockerfile to build an image named `my_cpp_app`.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container using:

```bash
docker run -it my_cpp_app
```

This command starts the container in interactive mode, running the C++ application.

## C++ Linked List Code

### `linklist.cpp`

The `linklist.cpp` file contains C++ code demonstrating various operations on a linked list, such as inserting nodes at the front, back, between nodes, removing nodes, and more.

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` contains instructions to build a Docker image capable of compiling and running the C++ linked list code.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Docker is installed and running.
3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Run the Docker container using the built image to interact with the C++ linked list application.

Feel free to modify the C++ code or Dockerfile to suit your requirements.

```

Please adjust the instructions or add more details as needed, and include any specific setup or configuration steps required for your application.
